"final" is used to indicate that a variable or method cannot be modified or overridden. Once a variable is declared as final, its value cannot be changed. Similarly, once a method is declared as final, it cannot be overridden in any subclass.

"static" is used to indicate that a variable or method belongs to the class itself, rather than to any instance of the class. This means that the variable or method can be accessed without creating an object of the class.
